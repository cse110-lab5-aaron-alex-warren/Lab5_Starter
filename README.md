Explore Part 3:
1. Yes, we would use unit testing on the "message" feature of a messaging application. Unit tests are designed to test individual units of code in isolation. Unit testing the messaging feature could verify that the message composition and sending functionality work as expected without needing to interact with external systems of dependencies like the network.
2. Yes, we would use unit testing on the "max message length" feature of a messaging application as well. This feature involves a specific rule that can be tested without involving other parts of the system. Unit testing in this scenario would determine if the application has the expected behavior when a message is too long.
